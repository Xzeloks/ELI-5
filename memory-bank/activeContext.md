# Active Context

The primary goal was to complete the core application features and undertake a major UI overhaul, bringing the app closer to a deployment-ready state.

This involved:
1.  Implementing the photo-to-text simplification feature. **[Done]**
2.  Completing robust chat message persistence using Supabase. **[Done & Verified via RLS]**
3.  **Major UI/UX Overhaul:** Implementing a persistent `CurvedNavigationBar` managed by `AppShell`, consolidating `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, and `SettingsScreen` into `AppShell`'s `PageView`. Implementing dark-mode only theme with blur background. **[Done]**
4.  Adding basic user profile/settings management (e.g., sign out). **[Done - Settings Screen Implemented, Theme Switch Removed]**
5.  Thorough testing of all features. **[Ongoing]**

Monetization (RevenueCat) and full Play Console deployment will follow now that the core features and UI structure are refined.

*   **Current Focus:** Finalizing `CurvedNavigationBar` styling (icon backgrounds) and ensuring the integrated UI (`AppShell` containing `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, `SettingsScreen` with blur background) is stable and visually correct. Preparing to implement session deletion and then move towards monetization.
*   **Recent Changes:**
    *   Replaced `BottomAppBar`/`FAB` with `CurvedNavigationBar`.
    *   Consolidated `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, `SettingsScreen` into `AppShell`'s `PageView`.
    *   Made `ChatScreen` the default initial screen within `AppShell`.
    *   Removed nested `Scaffold` widgets from page views.
    *   Ensured `CurvedNavigationBar` persists across main tabs.
    *   Enforced dark-mode only theme, removing light theme and UI switches.
    *   Replaced gradient background with solid color + `BackdropFilter` blur.
    *   Refined `CurvedNavigationBar` styling (colors, dynamic icons, selected icon background).
    *   Fixed navbar disappearing bug, `No Material widget found` error, dependency issues, and linter warnings.
    *   Refactored `ChatScreen` empty state layout.
*   **Next Steps (General):**
    1.  Finalize `CurvedNavigationBar` icon styling.
    2.  Implement Session Deletion from `HistoryListScreen`.
    3.  Conduct thorough testing of the complete user flow with the new UI.
    4.  Address any bugs or minor UI inconsistencies found during testing.
    5.  Prepare for reintegrating RevenueCat.
*   **Next Steps (Monetization - Upon Resuming):**
    1.  Uncomment RevenueCat initialization in `main.dart`.
    2.  Finalize Google Play Console setup for RevenueCat.
    3.  Obtain public Google Play API key from RevenueCat.
    4.  Update `main.dart` with the actual RevenueCat Google Play API key.
    5.  Implement Paywall UI screen.
    6.  Implement logic to fetch offerings and handle purchases.
    7.  Integrate paywall with AuthGate based on subscription status.
*   **Active Decisions:** Keep RevenueCat init disabled during UI stabilization and feature completion (session deletion). Focus on finalizing UI and core features before proceeding to monetization.
