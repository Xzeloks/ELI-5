# Chat Summary

This document summarizes the key interactions and development progress achieved during the chat session.

## 1. Initial Context & Correction
The conversation began with a misunderstanding of the user's current task, which was initially focused on Supabase deployment, not UI blur effects.

## 2. Supabase Edge Function Deployment (`openai-proxy`)
- **Goal:** Deploy a Supabase Edge Function to act as a proxy for OpenAI API calls, enhancing API key security.
- **Process & Challenges:**
    - Encountered Docker connectivity issues on Windows when trying to deploy the function. The primary error indicated that the Docker client needed elevated privileges.
    - **Resolution:** Ensured Docker Desktop was running and successfully deployed the function by executing `supabase functions deploy openai-proxy --no-verify-jwt --project-ref dhztoureixsskctbpovk` from a terminal running with administrator privileges.
- **Outcome:** The `openai-proxy` Edge Function was successfully deployed.

## 3. API Key Security Implementation (Flutter & Supabase)
- **Goal:** Refactor the Flutter app to use the new Supabase Edge Function, removing the OpenAI API key from the client-side.
- **Steps:**
    - Verified the TypeScript code for the Edge Function (`openai-proxy/index.ts` and `_shared/cors.ts`) and confirmed the `OPENAI_API_KEY` was correctly set as a secret in the Supabase project dashboard.
    - **Modified `OpenAIService.dart`:**
        - Removed the `apiKey` parameter from its methods.
        - Changed the API call URL to the deployed Supabase Edge Function (`https://dhztoureixsskctbpovk.supabase.co/functions/v1/openai-proxy`).
        - Implemented the use of `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (loaded from `.env`) in the headers for requests to the Edge Function.
    - **Updated Calling Code:**
        - Modified `ChatNotifier` in `chat_provider.dart` to no longer pass the `apiKey` to `OpenAIService`.
        - Modified `ChatScreen.dart` to remove `apiKey` from calls to `ChatNotifier`'s `sendMessageAndGetResponse` method.
        - Removed direct checks for `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env` within `ChatScreen.dart` that were causing "API Key not found" errors after the service layer refactor.
- **Outcome:** API key security was successfully implemented, with the key now managed server-side by the Supabase Edge Function.

## 4. Back Button Navigation Overhaul
- **Problem 1:** The system back button often exited the app from the `ChatScreen`, which was one of the main tabs in `AppShell`'s `PageView`.
- **Solution 1 (`AppShell`):**
    - Implemented `WillPopScope` in `AppShell.dart`.
    - Configured it so that if the user is on `HistoryListScreen` (index 0) or `SettingsScreen` (index 2), pressing back navigates them to `ChatScreen` (index 1, set as the main tab for back navigation).
    - If on `ChatScreen` (index 1), pressing back exits the app.
- **Problem 2:** When opening a specific chat from `HistoryListScreen`, the app still exited on back press instead of returning to the history list. This was because it was merely switching `AppShell`'s `PageView` to the shared `ChatScreen` instance.
- **Solution 2 (True Detail View for Chats):**
    - **Modified `ChatScreen.dart`:**
        - Added an optional `sessionId` constructor parameter.
        - In `initState`, if a `sessionId` is provided, the screen now loads that specific session using `ref.read(chatProvider.notifier).loadSession(sessionId)`.
        - Conditionally wrapped the screen's content in a new `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` (which provides an automatic back button) only when `sessionId` is present (i.e., when it's pushed as a detail view).
    - **Modified `_session_tile.dart`:**
        - Changed the `onTap` behavior for chat history items.
        - Instead of instructing `AppShell` to switch its `PageView` index, it now uses `Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => ChatScreen(sessionId: sessionId)))` to navigate to a new, distinct `ChatScreen` instance for the selected session.
- **Outcome:** Back button navigation became more intuitive. Pressing back from a specific chat now correctly returns to `HistoryListScreen`, while back navigation within the main `AppShell` tabs follows the defined `WillPopScope` logic.

## 5. Documentation & Housekeeping
- Updated memory bank files (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`, `implementationPlan.md`) to reflect the completion of the API key security and navigation tasks.
- The next major focus identified is "Implement Monetization (RevenueCat)". 

## 6. Settings Page UI Completion
- **Goal:** Finalize the UI for the `SettingsScreen`.
- **Initial State:** Page showed account info and sign-out/in button.
- **Enhancements:**
    - Added "Help & Feedback" section (Report a Bug, Contact Support).
    - Added "About" section (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service).
    - Added "Subscription" section (Manage Subscription).
    - Moved Sign Out/Sign In button to the bottom.
    - Removed `Divider` widgets for a cleaner look.
    - Removed "App Version" item as per request.
    - Used helper widgets `_buildSectionTitle` and `_buildSettingsListTile`.

## 7. Legal Documents & URL Launching
- **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service:**
    - Hosted `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md` on GitHub Pages.
    - Created placeholder files in `docs/` directory.
    - Reviewed and refined `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` to clarify location data (approximate via IP, not GPS) and PII (account info, user-generated content if linked, communications).
    - Integrated `url_launcher` package.
    - Added `_launchURL` helper in `SettingsScreen`.
    - Updated `ListTile`s to open GitHub Pages URLs:
        - Privacy Policy: `https://xzeloks.github.io/ELI-5/PRIVACY_POLICY.html`
        - Terms of Service: `https://xzeloks.github.io/ELI-5/TERMS_OF_SERVICE.html`
    - **Troubleshooting:** Resolved "Could not launch URL" by adding `<queries>` for `http` and `https` intents to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **Report a Bug & Contact Support:**
    - Used `ahen@gentartgrup.com.tr` for both.
    - Added `mailto` intent to `<queries>` in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    - `ListTile`s launch `mailto:` links with pre-filled subjects.

## 8. Manage Subscription (RevenueCat Integration)
- **Logic:**
    - Attempt to launch `customerInfo.managementURL` from RevenueCat.
    - Fallback to platform-specific store URLs (App Store/Play Store) if unavailable.
- Implemented in `onTap` for "Manage Subscription" in `SettingsScreen`, importing `purchases_flutter` and `dart:io`.

## 9. RevenueCat Initialization & Paywall
- **Initialization in `main.dart`:**
    - Uncommented `purchases_flutter` import.
    - Added `Purchases.setLogLevel(LogLevel.debug)`.
    - Configured `PurchasesConfiguration` with platform-specific API keys (Google Play: `goog_cDDinrdQJBPDaEiLIRWboxoywPd`).
    - Logged "RevenueCat configured successfully." "Error fetching offerings" was expected as products were not yet set up.
- **Paywall Implementation (`AuthGate`):**
    - Opted for RevenueCat-provided paywall.
    - **Troubleshooting `presentPaywallIfNeeded`:**
        - Method not found in `purchases_flutter`.
        - **Resolution:** Realized UI methods are in `purchases_ui_flutter`.
    - **Adding `purchases_ui_flutter`:**
        - Added to `pubspec.yaml`, initially `^7.0.0`.
        - Resolved version conflict with `purchases_flutter: ^8.0.0` by updating to `purchases_ui_flutter: ^8.8.0`.
    - Updated `AuthGate` to use `await RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded("premium")`.
- **Product Setup:**
    - User created `monthly:monthly` and `yearly:yearly` in RevenueCat (initially "Not found").
    - Advised app should be "Free" in Play Console, with "All or some functionality is restricted" for app access, requiring test account details.
    - Guided user on creating a Supabase test account.

## 10. Android Build Issues & Resolutions
- **`minSdkVersion` Error:** `purchases_ui_flutter` required `24`; project was `21`. Updated in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.
- **"package identifier or launch activity not found"**: Caused by `flutter clean` and `flutter create .` regenerating `AndroidManifest.xml` without `package`. Added `package="com.ahenyagan.eli5"`.
- **"Unsupported Gradle project"**:
    - **Solution:** Backed up `android` folder, deleted it, ran `flutter create .`.
    - **Re-applied Changes:**
        - `android/app/build.gradle.kts`: `namespace`, `applicationId` (`com.ahenyagan.eli5`), `minSdk` (`24`).
        - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: `package` attribute, `INTERNET` & `CAMERA` permissions, `queries` (`PROCESS_TEXT`, `VIEW` (http/https), `SENDTO` (mailto)).
- **NDK Version Mismatch & `ClassNotFoundException` for `MainActivity`:**
    - Updated `ndkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to `27.0.12077973`.
    - **Root Cause:** `MainActivity.kt` was in `com/example/eli5` path with `package com.example.eli5`.
    - User renamed `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/` to `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/ahenyagan/`.
    - Updated `package` in `MainActivity.kt` to `com.ahenyagan.eli5`.
- **RevenueCatUI `FlutterFragmentActivity` Requirement:**
    - App logged `E/PurchasesUIFlutter: Paywalls require your activity to subclass FlutterFragmentActivity`.
    - Updated `MainActivity.kt` to inherit from `FlutterFragmentActivity`.

## 11. Data Isolation & Chat Loading Issues
- **Issue 1: Seeing Other Users' Chats (Initially)**
    - Reported when logging in with a new email.
    - RLS policies for `chat_messages` and `chat_sessions` (`auth.uid() = user_id`) seemed correct.
    - Suspicion: Incorrect `user_id` with messages or stale client-side auth.
- **Issue 2: Blank Chat Page When Opening Sessions (Current)**
    - Occurs when opening chats from history.
    - Possible causes: RLS now correctly blocking access due to mismatched `user_id`s on older messages, or an error in message loading/display logic.
