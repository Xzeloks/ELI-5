# Progress

## [Current Date] - Onboarding Update, Release Prep (1.0.0+3), and Paywall Implementation

This period focused on refining the user's first experience with an updated onboarding message, preparing a new version for closed testing, and subsequently implementing a custom paywall screen that appears after the onboarding flow.

*   **Onboarding Text Enhancement (`lib/widgets/onboarding/app_breakdown_screen.dart`):**
    *   The introductory text on the first page of `AppBreakdownScreen` was updated to better explain the app's capabilities.
    *   First update: "ELI5 makes complex topics easy. Ask questions, share links, or use images to get simple explanations."
    *   Second update (final): "ELI5 makes complex topics easy. Ask questions, share links (including YouTube videos!), or use images to get simple explanations."

*   **Release Preparation for v1.0.0+3:**
    *   **Version Bump:** The `version` in `pubspec.yaml` was updated from `1.0.0+2` to `1.0.0+3`.
    *   **App Bundle Generation:** The command `flutter build appbundle --release` was successfully executed to create the Android App Bundle for the new version.
    *   **Release Notes:** Drafted initial release notes for Google Play Console submission, highlighting the new onboarding experience and its features.

*   **Custom Paywall Implementation & Integration:**
    *   **Strategic Decision:** Decided to build a custom UI for the paywall (`PaywallScreen.dart`) for greater design control, while still leveraging RevenueCat for managing purchases and subscriptions.
    *   **Placement:** The paywall is strategically placed to appear immediately after the user completes the multi-page onboarding flow (`AppBreakdownScreen`) and before they access the main application shell (`AppShell`).
    *   **`AuthGate.dart` Modifications:**
        *   Introduced `_shouldShowPaywall` (boolean state) and `hasSeenPaywallKey` (String for SharedPreferences key) to manage paywall visibility.
        *   Logic added: After `AppBreakdownScreen.onFinished` is called (signifying onboarding completion and `hasSeenOnboardingKey` being set), `AuthGate` now checks if `hasSeenPaywallKey` is false. If so, it sets `_shouldShowPaywall` to true.
        *   The `build` method in `AuthGate` now conditionally renders `PaywallScreen` if `_shouldShowPaywall` is true.
        *   `PaywallScreen` receives an `onContinueToApp` callback. This callback, when triggered from `PaywallScreen` (after successful purchase or choosing to proceed if allowed), updates `SharedPreferences` (sets `hasSeenPaywallKey` to true) and sets `_shouldShowPaywall` to false, allowing `AuthGate` to navigate to `AppShell`.
        *   Added `static const String routeName = '/app-shell';` to `lib/screens/app_shell.dart` for explicit navigation.
    *   **`PaywallScreen.dart` Development:**
        *   **Initial Setup:** Created the `PaywallScreen` stateful widget.
        *   **RevenueCat SDK:** Ensured RevenueCat SDK was initialized in `main.dart` (uncommented existing setup).
        *   **Fetching Offerings:**
            *   Created `offeringsProvider` (a `FutureProvider<Offerings>`) in `lib/providers/revenuecat_providers.dart` to fetch available packages from RevenueCat.
            *   Handled potential `PlatformException` during the fetch operation.
        *   **Displaying Packages:** The UI displays package details (title, description, price) obtained from the `offeringsProvider`.
        *   **Loading/Error States:** Basic UI implemented to show loading indicators while fetching offerings and error messages if fetching fails.
        *   **Purchase Logic (`_purchasePackage`):**
            *   Implemented a method to initiate a purchase using `Purchases.purchasePackage()`.
            *   After a successful purchase, it checks `customerInfo.entitlements.active.containsKey('Access')`.
            *   If the "Access" entitlement is active, the `onContinueToApp` callback is triggered.
        *   **RevenueCat Dashboard Configuration:**
            *   Addressed an initial "Error fetching offerings - PurchasesError(code=ConfigurationError...)" by guiding the user to correctly configure products, entitlements (settled on a single "Access" entitlement), and offerings (with associated packages - Monthly, Yearly, 6 Months) in their RevenueCat dashboard. Subsequent logs confirmed offerings were fetched successfully.
        *   **Restore Purchases:**
            *   Added a `_restorePurchases` method to allow users to restore previous purchases.
            *   Included a "Restore Purchases" button/link.
            *   Managed loading states (`_isRestoring`, `_isPurchasing`) to disable buttons during these operations.
        *   **Mandatory Paywall:** The "Maybe Later" button (option to bypass the paywall) was removed, making a subscription necessary to proceed to the app for users without the "Access" entitlement.
        *   **UI Styling (Minor):** The "Restore Purchases" link was styled as plain text in the footer, with the underline later removed by request.
        *   **Deferred UI Redesign:** A more elaborate UI redesign for `PaywallScreen` (based on a user-provided example including an app icon, feature list, radio-style package selection) was started but put on hold at the user's request to prioritize memory bank updates.
    *   **Confirmation:** The custom paywall implementation is now confirmed to be working as intended, with successful purchase and entitlement verification.

## [Current Date] - Password Reset Flow Correction

*   **Issue Identified:** Users were not redirected to the login screen after successfully resetting their password via a deep link. Instead, because the Supabase session remained active after `updateUser`, `AuthGate` treated them as logged in and navigated them to the main app flow (onboarding/paywall/app shell).
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Added detailed logging to `AuthGate` to trace `onAuthStateChange` events and the `_isInPasswordRecoveryMode` state.
    *   Utilized `adb logcat` to capture persistent logs when the direct Flutter debug connection was lost during deep link testing.
    *   Identified that `AuthChangeEvent.userUpdated` was correctly firing and `_isInPasswordRecoveryMode` was being set to `false`, but the active session (`session != null`) was causing the incorrect navigation.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Modified `NewPasswordScreen` (`lib/screens/auth/new_password_screen.dart`) to explicitly call `Supabase.instance.client.auth.signOut()` *after* a successful password update via `updateUser` and *before* navigating back to `AuthGate` (`Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil('/auth-gate', (route) => false)`).
*   **Outcome:** After a successful password reset, the user is now correctly signed out. `AuthGate` then detects a null session and, with `_isInPasswordRecoveryMode` being false, navigates the user to `AuthScreen` for login, as intended.

## [Current Date] - RevenueCat Integration, Paywall Logic & Testing

This phase focused on implementing and thoroughly debugging the in-app purchase functionality using RevenueCat, integrating it with Supabase authentication, and refining the paywall display logic.

*   **RevenueCat & Supabase User ID Sync:**
    *   Successfully implemented `Purchases.logIn(supabaseUserId)` in `AuthGate.dart` upon Supabase authentication to ensure purchases are correctly attributed.
    *   Implemented `Purchases.logOut()` in `SettingsScreen.dart` during user sign-out.
    *   Verified through console logs that the Supabase User ID is being used as the RevenueCat App User ID.
*   **Test Purchase Verification:**
    *   Confirmed that test purchases made with Google Play sandbox accounts are now visible in the RevenueCat dashboard when the "Sandbox data" toggle is enabled.
    *   Analyzed RevenueCat debug logs which showed successful receipt posting (`POST /receipts 200 OK`) and correct App User ID identification.
*   **`AuthGate.dart` Paywall & Navigation Logic:**
    *   Refactored `AuthGate.dart` to be a `ConsumerStatefulWidget`.
    *   Uses `customerInfoProvider` (a `FutureProvider<CustomerInfo>`) to check the status of the "Access" entitlement.
    *   Routes users directly to `AppShell` if subscribed.
    *   For non-subscribed users:
        *   Shows `AppBreakdownScreen` if not previously seen.
        *   Then shows `PaywallScreen` if `hasSeenPaywallKey` is false.
        *   Allows navigation to `AppShell` (free features) if paywall has been seen and dismissed.
*   **`PaywallScreen.dart` Enhancements & Fixes:**
    *   Removed direct navigation to `AppShell` after purchase; `AuthGate` now handles this based on `CustomerInfo` updates.
    *   Added `ref.invalidate(customerInfoProvider)` after successful purchase and restore operations to trigger UI updates.
    *   The entitlement ID "Access" is correctly used.
    *   An `offeringsProvider` was created and is used to fetch available packages.
*   **`SettingsScreen.dart` Subscription Management UI:**
    *   Updated to use `ref.watch(customerInfoProvider)`.
    *   Conditionally displays a "Manage Subscription" button if the "Access" entitlement is active.
    *   Shows a "View Subscription Options" button otherwise (placeholder, to be linked to the paywall).
*   **Log Analysis & Minor Issues Noted:**
    *   Reviewed extensive RevenueCat debug logs, confirming most operations are behaving as expected.
    *   Noted that "Response Verification" in RevenueCat SDK is currently `DISABLED`; recommended enabling for production.
    *   Observed Flutter performance warnings ("Skipped frames") in logs, suggesting potential UI thread work to optimize later.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Thorough end-to-end testing of all purchase flows: new user purchase, existing user subscription check, restore purchases, and paywall dismissal for free feature access.

## [Current Date] - UI Overhaul: Bottom Navigation and Chat Screen Refinement

Completed a significant UI overhaul based on user feedback and sketches, moving towards a more modern and intuitive interface:

*   **Implemented `AppShell`:**
    *   Introduced a new `AppShell` widget (`lib/screens/app_shell.dart`) to manage the main app structure with a bottom navigation bar.
    *   The bottom navigation now consists of "History", a central FloatingActionButton (FAB) for "New Chat", and "Settings".
    *   The previous "Chat" tab item was removed, with the FAB now fulfilling the "New Chat" action and defaulting to the chat screen.
*   **Refactored `ChatScreen` (`lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`):**
    *   **Empty State Redesign:** When a chat is empty, the screen now displays:
        *   Greeting and prompt at the top.
        *   The chat input bar directly below the prompt.
        *   A scrollable list of recent chat sessions below the input bar.
    *   Removed mock placeholder UI elements and conditional input logic (bar is now always present in its new location in the empty state).
*   **Created `HistoryListScreen` (`lib/screens/history_list_screen.dart`):**
    *   Adapted logic from the old `ChatSessionsDrawer` to create a dedicated screen for chat history, accessible from the new bottom navigation.
*   **Removed Obsolete Widgets:**
    *   Deleted the old `ChatSessionsDrawer` widget (`lib/widgets/chat_sessions_drawer.dart`).
*   **Addressed UI Issues:**
    *   Resolved `RenderFlex` overflow errors in the previous `BottomAppBar`.

## [Date of Recent Changes] - Curved Navigation, Blur Background, UI Consolidation

Further refined the UI and structure based on user feedback and visual examples:

*   **Implemented `CurvedNavigationBar`:**
    *   Replaced the `BottomAppBar` and central `FAB` in `AppShell` with the `curved_navigation_bar` package.
    *   Configured items for "History", "New Chat" (+ icon), and "Settings".
*   **Consolidated App Structure:**
    *   Integrated `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, and `SettingsScreen` into the `PageView` managed by `AppShell`.
    *   `ChatScreen` is now the default screen (index 0) shown after login.
    *   Ensured the `CurvedNavigationBar` remains persistent and functional across these three main screens.
    *   Removed nested `Scaffold` widgets from `HistoryListScreen` and `SettingsScreen` to resolve conflicts with `AppShell`'s main `Scaffold`.
    *   Updated navigation logic within `AppShell` and `HistoryListScreen` to correctly switch between the `PageView` tabs.
*   **Focused Dark Theme & Background Style:**
    *   Removed the light theme, `themeModeProvider`, and associated theme switching UI elements (ToggleButtons in Settings, Switch in ChatScreen empty state).
    *   Replaced the previous gradient background with a solid background color (`scaffoldBackgroundColor`).
    *   Applied a `BackdropFilter` with `ImageFilter.blur` to `AppShell` and `ChatScreen` for a blurred background effect.
*   **Navbar Styling Refinements:**
    *   Adjusted `CurvedNavigationBar` colors (`color`, `buttonBackgroundColor`, `backgroundColor`) to match the desired aesthetic (dark surface bar, background-matching curve).
    *   Implemented dynamic icon coloring (white when selected, grey when unselected).
    *   Added a helper method to render navbar icons within a circular filled purple background when selected.
*   **Bug Fixing and Stability:**
    *   Resolved the issue where the `CurvedNavigationBar` disappeared when switching tabs within `AppShell` by converting `AppShell` to a `ConsumerStatefulWidget` and managing `PageController` state correctly.
    *   Fixed `No Material widget found` error in `ChatScreen` by adding a `Material` ancestor.
    *   Resolved package dependency issues for `curved_navigation_bar`.
    *   Addressed various linter warnings and corrected `const` constructor errors.


*   **Current Status:** Post-MVP development. UI structure significantly refined with persistent curved bottom navigation. Dark theme enforced with blur background.
*   **What Works:**
    *   MVP features (Text simplification, API key handling, copy, etc.).
    *   Generic URL content fetching and simplification.
    *   YouTube video transcript fetching and simplification.
    *   Question answering via OpenAI.
    *   Supabase Authentication (Login, Sign Up, Logout).
    *   Chat History Persistence & Loading via Supabase.
    *   **Consolidated UI:** `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, `SettingsScreen` accessible via persistent `CurvedNavigationBar` within `AppShell`.
    *   Blurred background effect.
    *   Dark mode enforced.
*   **What's Next / To Do:**
    *   **Implement Monetization (RevenueCat) - In Progress:**
        *   Google Play Console setup & verifications pending.
        *   RevenueCat dashboard configuration in progress.
        *   SDK added to Flutter project.
    *   Implement Delete Session functionality from History screen.
    *   Implement API Key Security (Proxy via Supabase Edge Function).
    *   Further UI Polish & UX Improvements (e.g., navbar icon background style refinement).
    *   Advanced settings (e.g., choosing different GPT models, tone of simplification).
*   **What's Left:** Monetization, Session Deletion, API Key Security (Proxy), advanced settings, further UI polish, refactoring.
*   **Known Issues:**
    *   Requires manual creation/update of `.env` file.
    *   Basic HTML parsing for generic URLs.
    *   YouTube transcript only works if captions are available.
    *   Windows build requires Developer Mode enabled.

- Implemented `AuthGate` for automatic navigation based on auth state.
- Ensured `AuthGate` correctly navigates to `AppShell` on login and `AuthScreen` on logout.

### Android App Signing & Release Build
- Generated a release keystore (`upload-keystore.jks`) for Android.
- Created and configured `key.properties` to store signing credentials.
- Added `key.properties` to `.gitignore` to protect credentials.
- Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to load `key.properties` and use the release signing configuration.
- Successfully built the signed Android App Bundle (`app-release.aab`).
- Attempted to upload the AAB to Google Play Console for a closed test.
- Encountered requirements for completing store listing details (description, country selection, health declaration) before the test version can be fully processed.

### Next Steps & Shift in Focus
- Current focus is to complete core application features before finalizing Play Console setup and RevenueCat integration.

### Strategic Shift: Photo-to-Text Feature & Deployment Readiness (New Focus)
- Pivoted development focus towards adding a new feature: users can take photos of text, which is then processed (OCR) and sent to OpenAI for simplification.
- The overarching goal is to complete all core frontend and backend components to make the app deployment-ready.
- Subsequent efforts will focus on monetization and final publishing steps after the app is feature-complete and stable.

## [Current Date] - History Screen Revamp: Theming & Multi-select

*   **High Contrast & Theming Review:**
    *   Reviewed contrast ratios for key UI elements (History tiles, headers, chips; Chat bubbles; Nav bar; FAB) against WCAG AA guidelines.
    *   Identified and corrected contrast issue for the Session Tile subtitle text (`#757575` on `#2A2A2A`), changing it to `AppColors.textMediumEmphasisDark` (`#BDBDBD`).
    *   Confirmed other reviewed elements met contrast requirements.
*   **Multi-select in History Screen:**
    *   **State Management:** Added `StateProvider`s (`selectedSessionIdsProvider`, `isHistoryMultiSelectActiveProvider`, `batchSessionsPendingDeleteProvider`) to manage selection state and optimistic batch delete with undo.
    *   **Session Tile UI:** Implemented multi-select activation via long-press, selection toggling via tap, visual feedback (background highlight, checkmark icon), and disabled swipe actions during multi-select.
    *   **Contextual App Bar:** Created `_MultiSelectAppBar` widget displaying selected item count and action buttons (Clear Selection, Star/Unstar placeholder, Delete). Integrated into `HistoryListScreen` with an `AnimatedSwitcher`.
    *   **Batch Delete:** Implemented `deleteChatSessions` method in `ChatDbService`. Added confirmation dialog and optimistic "Undo" SnackBar functionality to the `_MultiSelectAppBar` delete action. Refined Undo/timeout logic to use `mounted` checks and correct provider state reading.
*   **Outstanding Issue:** The UI for the history list does not update immediately when "UNDO" is used for a *batch* delete; items only reappear after an app restart. Attempts to fix this by invalidating providers, using dynamic keys, and adding delays were unsuccessful.
*   **Pending:** Batch Star/Unstar functionality and Two-pane layout implementation for History screen. 

## [Date of Current Edits] - Batch Operations, UI Polish, and Navbar Iterations

This period focused on resolving the batch delete UNDO issue, implementing batch starring, and numerous UI refinements across `HistoryListScreen`, `AppShell`, and `ChatScreen`.

*   **Batch Delete UNDO Resolution:**
    *   **Root Cause Identified:** The `MultiSelectAppBar` was unmounted before its "UNDO" SnackBar action could execute, invalidating its `ref`.
    *   **Solution:** Refactored the UNDO action in `_multi_select_app_bar.dart` to use `ProviderScope.containerOf(context).read()` and `ProviderScope.containerOf(context).invalidate()` to interact with providers via the root `ProviderContainer`. This resolved the issue, and items now reappear instantly on UNDO.

*   **Batch Star/Unstar Implementation:**
    *   Added `updateMultipleSessionsStarredStatus` to `ChatDbService`.
    *   Implemented logic in `MultiSelectAppBar`'s star button `onPressed` callback using the `ProviderContainer` to read session data, determine new starred state, call the service, invalidate `chatSessionsProvider`, clear selection, and show a confirmation SnackBar.

*   **`HistoryListScreen` UI Polish:**
    *   **Navbar Collision:** Added `padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 90.0)` to `GroupedListView` to prevent items scrolling under `CurvedNavigationBar`.
    *   **List Header Styling (Sticky Headers):**
        *   Changed `groupSeparatorBuilder` from a boxy container to a "---- Text ----" style (`Row` with `Expanded(child: Divider())`, `Text`, `Expanded(child: Divider())`).
        *   Addressed issue where sticky headers blended with list items by wrapping the header `Row` in a `Material` widget with `elevation: 1.0`, `color: Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor`, and making the header text `FontWeight.bold`.
    *   **Filter Row Integration:** Changed `FilterRowWidget`'s `Material` background `color` to `Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor` (from `AppColors.inputFillDark`) to make it blend seamlessly with the page.
    *   **Navigation Fix:** Corrected `onTap` in `SessionTileWidget` (`_session_tile.dart`) to navigate to `AppShell` index `1` (ChatScreen) instead of `0`.

*   **`AppShell` & `CurvedNavigationBar` Iterations:**
    *   **Initial Color:** Experimented with `AppColors.nearBlack`, `AppColors.darkTealBlue`, and `AppColors.kopyaPurple` for the navbar `color`.
    *   **Darker Primary:** Added `AppColors.primaryDarkPurple = Color(0xFF3700B3)` and used it for the navbar.
    *   **Localized Blur Attempts (Iterative & Reverted):**
        *   Made navbar `buttonBackgroundColor` and `backgroundColor` transparent for main body blur.
        *   Moved `CurvedNavigationBar` into `AppShell.body` `Stack`, `Positioned` at bottom, wrapped in `ClipRect` and `BackdropFilter`. Set navbar `color` and `buttonBackgroundColor` to `AppColors.primaryDarkPurple.withOpacity(0.65)`.
        *   Adjusted `Container` height within `ClipRect` to give icon headroom and extend blur.
        *   Attempted `ShaderMask` with `LinearGradient` for a fading blur effect (reverted).
        *   Attempted fading navbar `Container`'s color with `LinearGradient` (reverted).
    *   **Final State:** Reverted navbar to be in `Scaffold.bottomNavigationBar` slot with solid `AppColors.primaryDarkPurple` color, `AppColors.kopyaPurple` for `buttonBackgroundColor`, and `Colors.transparent` for `backgroundColor` (for cutouts).

*   **`ChatScreen` UI & UX Polish:**
    *   **Navbar Overlap:** Added `SizedBox(height: 75.0)` at the bottom of the main `Column` to prevent `CurvedNavigationBar` from obscuring the chat input bar.
    *   **Recent Chats Navigation:** Corrected `onTap` in `_buildRecentChatsList` to navigate to `AppShell` index `1` (ChatScreen).
    *   **"Thinking" Animation:** Changed `SpinKitThreeBounce` color in `_buildProcessingIndicators` to `theme.colorScheme.primary`.
    *   **Chat Input Bar Refinements:**
        *   Increased `Container` `borderRadius` to `32.0` for a rounder shape.
        *   Updated `hintText` to: `"Ask ELI5 anything! Type, paste a URL, or use an image for AI-powered simplification."`
        *   Camera `IconButton`: Set `padding: EdgeInsets.zero`.
        *   Send button `Material`: Removed outer padding, set `borderRadius` to `24.0`.
        *   **Glow Effect:**
            *   Added a `BoxShadow` to the input bar's `Container` for a purple glow.
            *   Set input bar `Container`'s `color` to be opaque (`theme.inputDecorationTheme.fillColor ?? AppColors.inputFillDark`) to prevent glow bleed-through.
            *   Set glow `BoxShadow` `spreadRadius: 0.0`.
            *   Iteratively increased glow `BoxShadow` `blurRadius` from `4.0` to `6.0`, then to `12.0`. 

## [Current Date] - Chat Screen Polish, Delete Flow & Overflow Fixes

Continued refinement of the Chat and History screens, focusing on delete functionality consistency and visual polish.

*   **`ChatScreen` "Recent Chats" Delete Flow:**
    *   **Optimistic Delete with UNDO:** Refactored the delete functionality for items in the "Recent Chats" list on `ChatScreen` to mirror the behavior in `HistoryListScreen`.
        *   Implemented `_handleSimpleDeleteRecentSession` method in `chat_screen.dart`.
        *   The method now uses `sessionPendingDeleteIdProvider` for optimistic UI updates (item disappears immediately).
        *   An "UNDO" `SnackBar` is shown, allowing the user to revert the deletion.
        *   The actual database deletion occurs only if the SnackBar times out or is dismissed without pressing "UNDO".
    *   Corrected the `onDeleteRequested` callback in `_buildRecentChatsList` to properly call the new handler.

*   **`RenderFlex` Overflow in `SessionTileWidget`:**
    *   **Issue:** A minor `RenderFlex overflowed` error occurred in `SessionTileWidget` (used in both `HistoryListScreen` and `ChatScreen's recent chats) when `dense: true`, caused by the `SlidableActionPane`.
    *   **Solution:** Modified `_session_tile.dart` to conditionally reduce the `extentRatio` of the `ActionPane` from `0.75` to `0.70` when `widget.dense` is true. This resolved the overflow.

*   **AI Chat Bubble Distinction:**
    *   **Issue:** AI-generated messages on the `ChatScreen` used the same background color as the `scaffoldBackgroundColor`, making them blend in.
    *   **Solution:** Updated `lib/widgets/chat_message_bubble.dart` to use `AppColors.inputFillDark` for the `receiverColor` (AI messages). This provides a distinct, slightly lighter background for AI responses, improving readability. 

## UI Refinements, Glow Effects, and Fixes (Post-Simplification Styles)

- **Chat Input Bar Glow Effect:**
    - Added a purple `BoxShadow` to the input bar container on `ChatScreen` for a glow effect.
    - Iterated on shadow parameters (opacity, blurRadius, spreadRadius) for desired intensity.

- **Chat Message Bubble Glow Effect:**
    - Extended the glow effect to individual chat message bubbles by adding a similar `BoxShadow` to `ModernChatBubble`.
    - Ensured necessary imports (`AppColors` in `modern_chat_bubble.dart`).

- **Session Tile Glow Effect & History Screen Separator Line Fix:**
    - Implemented a purple glow effect for `SessionTileWidget` (used in "Recent Chats" on `ChatScreen` and on `HistoryListScreen`).
    - **Troubleshooting Separator Line Artifact:**
        - Investigated a faint line appearing under day separators (`Today`, `May 2025`, etc.) on `HistoryListScreen`.
        - Initial attempts involved adjusting `SessionTileWidget`'s shadow, padding, and background.
        - **Identified Root Cause:** The line was caused by `elevation: 1.0` on the `Material` widget in `HistoryListScreen's `groupSeparatorBuilder`.
        - **Solution:** Removed the `elevation` from the separator's `Material` widget, resolving the line artifact.
    - **Finalizing Tile Glow:**
        - After fixing the separator line, a consistent glow effect was re-established for `SessionTileWidget`.
        - The glow's size (`blurRadius`, `spreadRadius`) was adjusted for a more pronounced effect (`opacity: 0.20, blurRadius: 6.0, spreadRadius: 0.0, offset: const Offset(0, 3)`).

- **Navbar Color Iteration (`CurvedNavigationBar`):**
    - Experimented with several custom hex colors and `AppColors` for the navbar's `color` property.
    - Settled on using `AppColors.kopyaPurple` for both the navbar bar `color` and its `buttonBackgroundColor` for a consistent purple theme.

- **Authentication Screen `TabBar` Indicator Line Fix:**
    - Addressed an unwanted white line appearing under the "Create Account" / "Log In" tabs on `AuthScreen.dart`.
    - **Solution:** Set `indicatorColor: Colors.transparent`, `indicatorWeight: 0.0`, and `dividerColor: Colors.transparent` on the `TabBar` widget to fully suppress the default underline/divider.

- **Git Checkpoint:**
    - Created a git commit: "Checkpoint: Auth screen TabBar indicator line removed and navbar color finalized". 

## [Date of Last Edits - YYYY-MM-DD] - Paywall 'Try for Free' Debugging & OpenAI Model Upgrade

This period focused on troubleshooting the elusive issue of the "Try for Free" button not appearing for the monthly subscription on the paywall, alongside upgrading the underlying OpenAI models for improved chat performance and capabilities.

*   **Paywall - 'Try for Free' Investigation (Ongoing):**
    *   **Core Problem:** The `StoreProduct.introductoryPrice` field for the monthly package (identifier: `$rc_monthly`) is consistently reported as `null` by the RevenueCat SDK. This prevents the app from displaying the "Try for Free for 7 days" button, as the logic relies on this field being populated with a zero-price offer.
    *   **Deep Dive & Analysis:**
        *   Reviewed RevenueCat documentation and community forum posts, confirming that `introductoryPrice` being `null` is expected behavior if Google Play deems the current user ineligible for the introductory offer (e.g., free trial).
        *   Primary hypothesis: The Google account active in the Play Store on the test device has a history (e.g., previous test purchases, even if cancelled/refunded, or interaction with other subscriptions in the app) that makes it ineligible for the "new customer acquisition" type of free trial.
        *   Client-side code in `PaywallScreen.dart` was re-verified and deemed correct in how it checks `introductoryPrice` (specifically `introductoryPrice.price == 0`).
    *   **Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
        *   Enhanced logging in `PaywallScreen.dart`'s `_buildPackageSelector` to output detailed `StoreProduct` and `introductoryPrice` information for *all* available packages, clearly identifying the package by its identifier and type.
        *   Confirmed the `purchases_flutter` (RevenueCat SDK) is at a recent version (`^8.0.0`).
        *   Re-verified the `freetrial` offer configuration for the `monthly` product in the Google Play Console (active, price 0, 7 days, eligibility: new customer acquisition).
        *   Confirmed RevenueCat's server-to-server (S2S) notification setup with Google Cloud Pub/Sub is correctly configured (Topic ID: `projects/eli-5-459017/topics/Play-Store-Notifications`), though this is more for post-purchase event tracking than initial offer fetching.
        *   Clarified that `introductoryPrice` isn't exclusive to free trials but covers any introductory pricing; the app correctly checks for `price == 0`.
    *   **Key Recommended Next Step:** Conduct thorough testing with a completely new ("pristine") Google account on a clean device/emulator to isolate offer eligibility.

*   **OpenAI Model Upgrade:**
    *   Updated `OpenAIService.dart` to utilize newer OpenAI models.
    *   Default model changed to `gpt-4o-mini` for general chat interactions.
    *   `gpt-4o` is now used for processing potentially larger inputs (e.g., long web content, YouTube transcripts) to leverage its larger context window.
    *   Adjusted internal character/token truncation limits (`_userContentTruncationCharsShort`, `_userContentTruncationCharsLong`, `_maxTokensForShortModel`, `_maxTokensForLongModel`) to align with the capabilities of these models and prevent errors.

*   **App Versioning & Release Prep:**
    *   Incremented the app version in `pubspec.yaml` to `1.0.0+6` in preparation for a new tester release on the Google Play Console.
    *   Provided guidance on filling out release notes for the Play Console, focusing on the AI model upgrade and ongoing UI/UX refinements.
    *   Assisted with understanding and addressing the Google Play Console's Advertising ID declaration requirements.

*   **Miscellaneous:**
    *   Investigated and explained behavior related to password reset deep links and the necessary `AndroidManifest.xml` intent filter for `login-callback` (distinct from `auth-callback`).
    *   Briefly touched upon Android 13 `AD_ID` permission manifest entries.


## [Date of Previous Edits] - API Key Security & Navigation Overhaul

### Implemented API Key Security (Proxy via Supabase Edge Function)
- **Goal:** Secure the OpenAI API key by not bundling it with the client-side Flutter app.
- **Steps & Outcome:**
    - Successfully created and deployed a Supabase Edge Function named `openai-proxy`.
        - Wrote TypeScript code for the function to:
            - Handle CORS.
            - Receive prompt data from the Flutter app.
            - Fetch the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from Supabase environment secrets.
            - Make the actual call to the OpenAI API.
            - Return the response to the Flutter app.
        - Created a shared `_shared/cors.ts` file for CORS headers.
    - Stored the `OPENAI_API_KEY` securely as an environment variable (secret) in the Supabase project settings.
    - **Troubleshooting:** Resolved Docker connectivity issues during Supabase deployment by ensuring Docker Desktop was running and by executing deployment commands from an administrator terminal on Windows. This was critical for `supabase functions deploy`.
    - Modified `OpenAIService` in the Flutter application:
        - Removed the direct OpenAI API key parameter from methods (`fetchSimplifiedText`, `getChatResponse`).
        - Updated methods to call the new Supabase Edge Function URL.
        - Added logic to use `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (from `.env`) for authorizing requests to the Edge Function.
    - Updated calling code in `ChatNotifier` (`chat_provider.dart`) and `ChatScreen` (`chat_screen.dart`) to no longer pass the OpenAI API key directly, and removed outdated API key checks from the UI.
- **Status:** Completed. API key is no longer exposed on the client-side.

### Enhanced Back Button Navigation Logic
- **Initial Problem:** System back button often exited the app unexpectedly, especially from `ChatScreen`.
- **Solution Part 1: `AppShell` `WillPopScope` for `PageView`**
    - Implemented `WillPopScope` in `AppShell.dart` to manage back navigation for the main `PageView` (tabs: History, Chat, Settings).
    - Logic:
        - If on History (index 0) or Settings (index 2), pressing back navigates to Chat (index 1 - set as the main/home tab).
        - If on Chat (index 1), pressing back exits the app.
    - This provided more controlled navigation between the main tabs.
- **Initial Problem (Continued):** Opening a specific chat from `HistoryListScreen` still used the `AppShell`'s `PageView` instance of `ChatScreen`, leading to the app exiting on back press instead of returning to history.
- **Solution Part 2: True Detail View for Specific Chats**
    - Modified `ChatScreen.dart`:
        - Added an optional `sessionId` parameter to its constructor.
        - If a `sessionId` is provided, `initState` now calls `ref.read(chatProvider.notifier).loadSession(sessionId)`.
        - Conditionally added a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` to `ChatScreen` when a `sessionId` is present. This `AppBar` automatically provides a back button for pushed routes.
    - Modified `_session_tile.dart` (in `HistoryListScreen`):
        - Changed the `onTap` action for a chat session.
        - Instead of switching `AppShell`'s `PageView` index, it now uses `Navigator.push()` to navigate to a *new instance* of `ChatScreen`, passing the specific `sessionId`.
- **Outcome:**
    - Back button navigation is now more intuitive.
    - Pressing back from a specific chat session (opened as a detail view) correctly returns to `HistoryListScreen`.
    - Back navigation within the main `AppShell` tabs follows the defined `WillPopScope` logic.

## [Date] - Settings Page UI, Legal Docs, RevenueCat Init & Build Fixes

- **Settings Page UI (`lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`):**
    - Completed UI: Added "Help & Feedback" (Report Bug, Contact Support) and "About" (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) sections.
    - Added "Subscription" section (Manage Subscription).
    - Used helper widgets `_buildSectionTitle` and `_buildSettingsListTile`.
    - Moved Sign Out/In button to bottom, removed dividers.
- **Legal Documents & URL Launching:**
    - Hosted `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` & `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md` on GitHub Pages.
    - Refined `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` content regarding data collection.
    - Integrated `url_launcher` to open these URLs and `mailto:` links for support/bug reports.
    - Added necessary `<queries>` to `AndroidManifest.xml` for `http/https` and `mailto` intents.
- **Manage Subscription (RevenueCat):**
    - Implemented `onTap` logic for "Manage Subscription" to launch RevenueCat's `managementURL` or fallback to store URLs.
- **RevenueCat Initialization & Paywall:**
    - Initialized RevenueCat in `main.dart` with Google Play API key.
    - Added `purchases_ui_flutter` for RevenueCat's paywall.
    - Implemented `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded("premium")` in `AuthGate`.
    - Guided on product setup in RevenueCat & Play Console (test accounts).
- **Android Build Issues & Resolutions:**
    - Updated `minSdkVersion` to `24` for `purchases_ui_flutter`.
    - Fixed "package identifier not found" by adding `package` to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    - Resolved "Unsupported Gradle project" by regenerating `android` folder and reapplying essential configurations (`namespace`, `applicationId`, `minSdk`, permissions, queries).
    - Corrected NDK version mismatch and `MainActivity` `ClassNotFoundException` by updating `ndkVersion`, renaming package path from `com/example/eli5` to `com/ahenyagan/eli5`, and updating `package` in `MainActivity.kt`.
    - Updated `MainActivity.kt` to inherit from `FlutterFragmentActivity` for RevenueCat UI.
- **Data Isolation / Chat Loading Issues:**
    - Investigated initial reports of seeing other users' chats.
    - Currently troubleshooting blank chat pages when opening sessions from history (possibly RLS related or loading logic).

## [Current Date] - Google Play Console: Production Readiness
- **Shift in Focus:** Addressed requirements for applying for production access in the Google Play Console.
- **Tasks Initiated:**
    - Setting up a closed test track.
    - Understanding requirements: publishing a closed test version, enrolling 12+ testers, and testing for 14+ days. 

## [Current Date] - Play Store Prep, Deep Linking, & Paywall Strategy

Focused on preparing the app for Google Play Console production access and refining the authentication flow:

*   **Google Play Console - Closed Testing Preparation:**
    *   Outlined requirements for production access: closed test track, min. 12 testers, 14-day testing period.
    *   Discussed strategy for providing Google Review access to the app with a RevenueCat paywall (test credentials).
*   **Supabase Auth & Deep Linking Implementation (for email verification):**
    *   **Issue:** Auth emails redirecting to `localhost:3000`.
    *   **Solution:** Implemented deep linking for auth callbacks.
        *   Set Supabase "Site URL" to `com.ahenyagan.eli5://auth-ca`.
        *   Configured `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android) with an intent filter for the scheme `com.ahenyagan.eli5` and host `auth-ca`.
        *   Configured `Info.plist` (iOS) with `CFBundleURLTypes` for the `com.ahenyagan.eli5` scheme.
        *   **Package Migration:** Replaced the discontinued `uni_links` package with `app_links`.
            *   Updated `pubspec.yaml` and ran `flutter pub get`.
            *   Resolved build failure caused by `uni_links` missing Android `namespace`.
        *   Updated `lib/widgets/auth_gate.dart` to use `AppLinks().uriLinkStream` to listen for and handle incoming deep links from Supabase for email authentication.
*   **Paywall Design Discussion:**
    *   Reviewed the RevenueCat paywall editor.
    *   Decided to build a custom paywall UI in Flutter for greater flexibility, while continuing to use RevenueCat for backend subscription management.

## [Current Date] - Production Readiness Review & Fixes

*   **Custom Paywall Confirmation:** Confirmed that the app is utilizing the custom `PaywallScreen.dart` as intended for managing user subscriptions via RevenueCat.
*   **Chat Loading & Data Isolation Resolved:** Addressed the issue where opening chat sessions from history sometimes resulted in a blank page. This was investigated in the context of Supabase RLS policies and Flutter data loading logic in `ChatNotifier` and `ChatDbService`.
*   **iOS RevenueCat API Key:** Placeholder for iOS API key in `lib/main.dart` identified and highlighted for user to update with their actual key.

## [Current Date] - Chatbot Prompt Enhancements & Response Quality

Based on tester feedback regarding generic chatbot responses, the following improvements were made:

*   **Issue Identified:** The chatbot provided generic responses to questions about app usage (e.g., "Can you give me some examples of how to use this app?") because the OpenAI system prompt lacked specific context about the ELI5 app's features.
*   **Solution - System Prompt Augmentation (`lib/services/openai_service.dart`):**
    *   The system prompt for the `SimplificationStyle.eli5` and the `default` fallback case in `OpenAIService` was significantly updated.
    *   **Added App-Specific Context:** A section titled "About the ELI5 App and How to Use It:" was added to the prompt. This section details key app functionalities:
        *   Pasting text for simplification.
        *   Sharing URLs/links (including YouTube) for content explanation.
        *   Using the camera (OCR) to scan and explain real-world text.
        *   Asking general questions.
        *   Choosing different explanation styles (ELI5, Summary, Expert).
    *   **Instruction for App Usage Questions:** The prompt now explicitly instructs the AI: "If a user asks for examples of how to use the app, you can describe some of these common uses in a conversational way."
    *   **Improved Response Style Guidance:**
        *   The prompt was rephrased to encourage more natural, conversational language from the chatbot.
        *   It now includes the instruction: "Try to vary your sentence structure and avoid using lists for every explanation, unless a list is the most natural way to answer (e.g., for specific steps)."
        *   The examples within the "About the ELI5 App" section were also rephrased to be more narrative and less like a direct list to further guide the AI's response style.
*   **Clarification on URL/YouTube Handling:** Confirmed that the existing architecture in `ChatProvider` correctly pre-processes URLs by fetching their content/transcripts and then sends this textual data to `OpenAIService`. The AI is informed that "The user shared this link..." or "The user shared this YouTube video..." along with the extracted content. The updated system prompt aligns with this by describing these features.
*   **Outcome:** The chatbot is now better equipped to provide specific examples of app usage and should generate responses in a more natural, less list-heavy style.

*   **User Request - AI-Generated App Description:**
    *   Provided the user with a detailed prompt they can use to have an external AI generate a comprehensive description of the ELI5 app, covering its concept, features, and tech stack.
    *   Subsequently, upon user clarification, provided an AI-to-AI prompt, demonstrating how I (as an AI) would instruct another AI to generate the app description.
    *   Finally, provided an "honest description" of the app from my AI perspective, focusing on a balanced assessment of its features, strengths, and underlying mechanisms, suitable for internal review or market research insight.

*   **UI Feedback:** Added visual feedback for thumbs-up/down selection and button placement adjustments.
*   **Report Feature:** Implemented the "Report Explanation" feature with a dialog and Supabase integration.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Successfully implemented TTS for AI explanations using OpenAI TTS via a secure Supabase Edge Function (`openai-tts-proxy`). This involved extensive local setup, debugging, and deployment to Supabase Cloud.

### Next Steps

*   Continue with Phase 2 improvements: Enhanced Content Sharing (Copy Text, Social Sharing).
