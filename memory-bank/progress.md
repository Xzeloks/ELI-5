# Progress

## [Current Date] - UI Overhaul: Bottom Navigation and Chat Screen Refinement

Completed a significant UI overhaul based on user feedback and sketches, moving towards a more modern and intuitive interface:

*   **Implemented `AppShell`:**
    *   Introduced a new `AppShell` widget (`lib/screens/app_shell.dart`) to manage the main app structure with a bottom navigation bar.
    *   The bottom navigation now consists of "History", a central FloatingActionButton (FAB) for "New Chat", and "Settings".
    *   The previous "Chat" tab item was removed, with the FAB now fulfilling the "New Chat" action and defaulting to the chat screen.
*   **Refactored `ChatScreen` (`lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`):**
    *   **Empty State Redesign:** When a chat is empty, the screen now displays:
        *   Greeting and prompt at the top.
        *   The chat input bar directly below the prompt.
        *   A scrollable list of recent chat sessions below the input bar.
    *   Removed mock placeholder UI elements and conditional input logic (bar is now always present in its new location in the empty state).
*   **Created `HistoryListScreen` (`lib/screens/history_list_screen.dart`):**
    *   Adapted logic from the old `ChatSessionsDrawer` to create a dedicated screen for chat history, accessible from the new bottom navigation.
*   **Removed Obsolete Widgets:**
    *   Deleted the old `ChatSessionsDrawer` widget (`lib/widgets/chat_sessions_drawer.dart`).
*   **Addressed UI Issues:**
    *   Resolved `RenderFlex` overflow errors in the previous `BottomAppBar`.

## [Date of Recent Changes] - Curved Navigation, Blur Background, UI Consolidation

Further refined the UI and structure based on user feedback and visual examples:

*   **Implemented `CurvedNavigationBar`:**
    *   Replaced the `BottomAppBar` and central `FAB` in `AppShell` with the `curved_navigation_bar` package.
    *   Configured items for "History", "New Chat" (+ icon), and "Settings".
*   **Consolidated App Structure:**
    *   Integrated `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, and `SettingsScreen` into the `PageView` managed by `AppShell`.
    *   `ChatScreen` is now the default screen (index 0) shown after login.
    *   Ensured the `CurvedNavigationBar` remains persistent and functional across these three main screens.
    *   Removed nested `Scaffold` widgets from `HistoryListScreen` and `SettingsScreen` to resolve conflicts with `AppShell`'s main `Scaffold`.
    *   Updated navigation logic within `AppShell` and `HistoryListScreen` to correctly switch between the `PageView` tabs.
*   **Focused Dark Theme & Background Style:**
    *   Removed the light theme, `themeModeProvider`, and associated theme switching UI elements (ToggleButtons in Settings, Switch in ChatScreen empty state).
    *   Replaced the previous gradient background with a solid background color (`scaffoldBackgroundColor`).
    *   Applied a `BackdropFilter` with `ImageFilter.blur` to `AppShell` and `ChatScreen` for a blurred background effect.
*   **Navbar Styling Refinements:**
    *   Adjusted `CurvedNavigationBar` colors (`color`, `buttonBackgroundColor`, `backgroundColor`) to match the desired aesthetic (dark surface bar, background-matching curve).
    *   Implemented dynamic icon coloring (white when selected, grey when unselected).
    *   Added a helper method to render navbar icons within a circular filled purple background when selected.
*   **Bug Fixing and Stability:**
    *   Resolved the issue where the `CurvedNavigationBar` disappeared when switching tabs within `AppShell` by converting `AppShell` to a `ConsumerStatefulWidget` and managing `PageController` state correctly.
    *   Fixed `No Material widget found` error in `ChatScreen` by adding a `Material` ancestor.
    *   Resolved package dependency issues for `curved_navigation_bar`.
    *   Addressed various linter warnings and corrected `const` constructor errors.


*   **Current Status:** Post-MVP development. UI structure significantly refined with persistent curved bottom navigation. Dark theme enforced with blur background.
*   **What Works:**
    *   MVP features (Text simplification, API key handling, copy, etc.).
    *   Generic URL content fetching and simplification.
    *   YouTube video transcript fetching and simplification.
    *   Question answering via OpenAI.
    *   Supabase Authentication (Login, Sign Up, Logout).
    *   Chat History Persistence & Loading via Supabase.
    *   **Consolidated UI:** `ChatScreen`, `HistoryListScreen`, `SettingsScreen` accessible via persistent `CurvedNavigationBar` within `AppShell`.
    *   Blurred background effect.
    *   Dark mode enforced.
*   **What's Next / To Do:**
    *   **Implement Monetization (RevenueCat) - In Progress:**
        *   Google Play Console setup & verifications pending.
        *   RevenueCat dashboard configuration in progress.
        *   SDK added to Flutter project.
    *   Implement Delete Session functionality from History screen.
    *   Implement API Key Security (Proxy via Supabase Edge Function).
    *   Further UI Polish & UX Improvements (e.g., navbar icon background style refinement).
    *   Advanced settings (e.g., choosing different GPT models, tone of simplification).
*   **What's Left:** Monetization, Session Deletion, API Key Security (Proxy), advanced settings, further UI polish, refactoring.
*   **Known Issues:**
    *   Requires manual creation/update of `.env` file.
    *   Basic HTML parsing for generic URLs.
    *   YouTube transcript only works if captions are available.
    *   Windows build requires Developer Mode enabled.

- Implemented `AuthGate` for automatic navigation based on auth state.
- Ensured `AuthGate` correctly navigates to `AppShell` on login and `AuthScreen` on logout.

### Android App Signing & Release Build
- Generated a release keystore (`upload-keystore.jks`) for Android.
- Created and configured `key.properties` to store signing credentials.
- Added `key.properties` to `.gitignore` to protect credentials.
- Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to load `key.properties` and use the release signing configuration.
- Successfully built the signed Android App Bundle (`app-release.aab`).
- Attempted to upload the AAB to Google Play Console for a closed test.
- Encountered requirements for completing store listing details (description, country selection, health declaration) before the test version can be fully processed.

### Next Steps & Shift in Focus
- Current focus is to complete core application features before finalizing Play Console setup and RevenueCat integration.

### Strategic Shift: Photo-to-Text Feature & Deployment Readiness (New Focus)
- Pivoted development focus towards adding a new feature: users can take photos of text, which is then processed (OCR) and sent to OpenAI for simplification.
- The overarching goal is to complete all core frontend and backend components to make the app deployment-ready.
- Subsequent efforts will focus on monetization and final publishing steps after the app is feature-complete and stable.

## [Current Date] - History Screen Revamp: Theming & Multi-select

*   **High Contrast & Theming Review:**
    *   Reviewed contrast ratios for key UI elements (History tiles, headers, chips; Chat bubbles; Nav bar; FAB) against WCAG AA guidelines.
    *   Identified and corrected contrast issue for the Session Tile subtitle text (`#757575` on `#2A2A2A`), changing it to `AppColors.textMediumEmphasisDark` (`#BDBDBD`).
    *   Confirmed other reviewed elements met contrast requirements.
*   **Multi-select in History Screen:**
    *   **State Management:** Added `StateProvider`s (`selectedSessionIdsProvider`, `isHistoryMultiSelectActiveProvider`, `batchSessionsPendingDeleteProvider`) to manage selection state and optimistic batch delete with undo.
    *   **Session Tile UI:** Implemented multi-select activation via long-press, selection toggling via tap, visual feedback (background highlight, checkmark icon), and disabled swipe actions during multi-select.
    *   **Contextual App Bar:** Created `_MultiSelectAppBar` widget displaying selected item count and action buttons (Clear Selection, Star/Unstar placeholder, Delete). Integrated into `HistoryListScreen` with an `AnimatedSwitcher`.
    *   **Batch Delete:** Implemented `deleteChatSessions` method in `ChatDbService`. Added confirmation dialog and optimistic "Undo" SnackBar functionality to the `_MultiSelectAppBar` delete action. Refined Undo/timeout logic to use `mounted` checks and correct provider state reading.
*   **Outstanding Issue:** The UI for the history list does not update immediately when "UNDO" is used for a *batch* delete; items only reappear after an app restart. Attempts to fix this by invalidating providers, using dynamic keys, and adding delays were unsuccessful.
*   **Pending:** Batch Star/Unstar functionality and Two-pane layout implementation for History screen. 

## [Date of Current Edits] - Batch Operations, UI Polish, and Navbar Iterations

This period focused on resolving the batch delete UNDO issue, implementing batch starring, and numerous UI refinements across `HistoryListScreen`, `AppShell`, and `ChatScreen`.

*   **Batch Delete UNDO Resolution:**
    *   **Root Cause Identified:** The `MultiSelectAppBar` was unmounted before its "UNDO" SnackBar action could execute, invalidating its `ref`.
    *   **Solution:** Refactored the UNDO action in `_multi_select_app_bar.dart` to use `ProviderScope.containerOf(context).read()` and `ProviderScope.containerOf(context).invalidate()` to interact with providers via the root `ProviderContainer`. This resolved the issue, and items now reappear instantly on UNDO.

*   **Batch Star/Unstar Implementation:**
    *   Added `updateMultipleSessionsStarredStatus` to `ChatDbService`.
    *   Implemented logic in `MultiSelectAppBar`'s star button `onPressed` callback using the `ProviderContainer` to read session data, determine new starred state, call the service, invalidate `chatSessionsProvider`, clear selection, and show a confirmation SnackBar.

*   **`HistoryListScreen` UI Polish:**
    *   **Navbar Collision:** Added `padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 90.0)` to `GroupedListView` to prevent items scrolling under `CurvedNavigationBar`.
    *   **List Header Styling (Sticky Headers):**
        *   Changed `groupSeparatorBuilder` from a boxy container to a "---- Text ----" style (`Row` with `Expanded(child: Divider())`, `Text`, `Expanded(child: Divider())`).
        *   Addressed issue where sticky headers blended with list items by wrapping the header `Row` in a `Material` widget with `elevation: 1.0`, `color: Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor`, and making the header text `FontWeight.bold`.
    *   **Filter Row Integration:** Changed `FilterRowWidget`'s `Material` background `color` to `Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor` (from `AppColors.inputFillDark`) to make it blend seamlessly with the page.
    *   **Navigation Fix:** Corrected `onTap` in `SessionTileWidget` (`_session_tile.dart`) to navigate to `AppShell` index `1` (ChatScreen) instead of `0`.

*   **`AppShell` & `CurvedNavigationBar` Iterations:**
    *   **Initial Color:** Experimented with `AppColors.nearBlack`, `AppColors.darkTealBlue`, and `AppColors.kopyaPurple` for the navbar `color`.
    *   **Darker Primary:** Added `AppColors.primaryDarkPurple = Color(0xFF3700B3)` and used it for the navbar.
    *   **Localized Blur Attempts (Iterative & Reverted):**
        *   Made navbar `buttonBackgroundColor` and `backgroundColor` transparent for main body blur.
        *   Moved `CurvedNavigationBar` into `AppShell.body` `Stack`, `Positioned` at bottom, wrapped in `ClipRect` and `BackdropFilter`. Set navbar `color` and `buttonBackgroundColor` to `AppColors.primaryDarkPurple.withOpacity(0.65)`.
        *   Adjusted `Container` height within `ClipRect` to give icon headroom and extend blur.
        *   Attempted `ShaderMask` with `LinearGradient` for a fading blur effect (reverted).
        *   Attempted fading navbar `Container`'s color with `LinearGradient` (reverted).
    *   **Final State:** Reverted navbar to be in `Scaffold.bottomNavigationBar` slot with solid `AppColors.primaryDarkPurple` color, `AppColors.kopyaPurple` for `buttonBackgroundColor`, and `Colors.transparent` for `backgroundColor` (for cutouts).

*   **`ChatScreen` UI & UX Polish:**
    *   **Navbar Overlap:** Added `SizedBox(height: 75.0)` at the bottom of the main `Column` to prevent `CurvedNavigationBar` from obscuring the chat input bar.
    *   **Recent Chats Navigation:** Corrected `onTap` in `_buildRecentChatsList` to navigate to `AppShell` index `1` (ChatScreen).
    *   **"Thinking" Animation:** Changed `SpinKitThreeBounce` color in `_buildProcessingIndicators` to `theme.colorScheme.primary`.
    *   **Chat Input Bar Refinements:**
        *   Increased `Container` `borderRadius` to `32.0` for a rounder shape.
        *   Updated `hintText` to: `"Ask ELI5 anything! Type, paste a URL, or use an image for AI-powered simplification."`
        *   Camera `IconButton`: Set `padding: EdgeInsets.zero`.
        *   Send button `Material`: Removed outer padding, set `borderRadius` to `24.0`.
        *   **Glow Effect:**
            *   Added a `BoxShadow` to the input bar's `Container` for a purple glow.
            *   Set input bar `Container`'s `color` to be opaque (`theme.inputDecorationTheme.fillColor ?? AppColors.inputFillDark`) to prevent glow bleed-through.
            *   Set glow `BoxShadow` `spreadRadius: 0.0`.
            *   Iteratively increased glow `BoxShadow` `blurRadius` from `4.0` to `6.0`, then to `12.0`. 

## [Current Date] - Chat Screen Polish, Delete Flow & Overflow Fixes

Continued refinement of the Chat and History screens, focusing on delete functionality consistency and visual polish.

*   **`ChatScreen` "Recent Chats" Delete Flow:**
    *   **Optimistic Delete with UNDO:** Refactored the delete functionality for items in the "Recent Chats" list on `ChatScreen` to mirror the behavior in `HistoryListScreen`.
        *   Implemented `_handleSimpleDeleteRecentSession` method in `chat_screen.dart`.
        *   The method now uses `sessionPendingDeleteIdProvider` for optimistic UI updates (item disappears immediately).
        *   An "UNDO" `SnackBar` is shown, allowing the user to revert the deletion.
        *   The actual database deletion occurs only if the SnackBar times out or is dismissed without pressing "UNDO".
    *   Corrected the `onDeleteRequested` callback in `_buildRecentChatsList` to properly call the new handler.

*   **`RenderFlex` Overflow in `SessionTileWidget`:**
    *   **Issue:** A minor `RenderFlex overflowed` error occurred in `SessionTileWidget` (used in both `HistoryListScreen` and `ChatScreen's recent chats) when `dense: true`, caused by the `SlidableActionPane`.
    *   **Solution:** Modified `_session_tile.dart` to conditionally reduce the `extentRatio` of the `ActionPane` from `0.75` to `0.70` when `widget.dense` is true. This resolved the overflow.

*   **AI Chat Bubble Distinction:**
    *   **Issue:** AI-generated messages on the `ChatScreen` used the same background color as the `scaffoldBackgroundColor`, making them blend in.
    *   **Solution:** Updated `lib/widgets/chat_message_bubble.dart` to use `AppColors.inputFillDark` for the `receiverColor` (AI messages). This provides a distinct, slightly lighter background for AI responses, improving readability.
