*   **Client-Side Auth State for Chat History:**
    *   **Issue:** Chat history (list of sessions) was not updating correctly after user logout and login with a new account, showing the previous user's chat sessions.
    *   **Fix:**
        1.  Created `authUserStreamProvider` in `lib/main.dart` to expose the Supabase `User` object through a stream that updates on auth state changes.
        2.  Modified `chatSessionsProvider` in `lib/providers/chat_provider.dart` to watch `authUserStreamProvider`. This ensures the list of chat sessions is re-fetched with the correct user ID when the authenticated user changes.
        3.  Updated the `_signOut` method in `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` to accept `WidgetRef` and explicitly invalidate `chatSessionsProvider` and clear the active chat state in `chatProvider` for robustness.
    *   **Status:** Implemented and verified. Chat history now correctly reflects the currently logged-in user.
*   **Temporarily Disabled RevenueCat Integration:**
    *   **Reason:** To simplify the app for a potential review or to focus on non-monetization features before full IAP setup.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Commented out RevenueCat initialization in `lib/main.dart`.
        *   Commented out paywall presentation logic (`_presentPaywallIfNeeded` and its call) in `lib/widgets/auth_gate.dart`.
        *   Commented out the "Manage Subscription" UI in `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`.
    *   **Next Steps (Later):** These sections will need to be uncommented to re-enable and configure monetization.
    *   **Status:** Done.
*   **Google Play Store Listing - Main Store Listing Details:**
    *   **Task:** Started filling out the main store listing information in Google Play Console.
    *   **Progress:**
        *   App Name (`ELI-5`) confirmed.
        *   Drafted options for the Short Description (80 chars).
        *   Drafted a comprehensive Full Description (4000 chars), outlining key features and benefits.
    *   **Next Steps:** Finalize descriptions, prepare and upload graphics (icon, feature graphic, screenshots).
    *   **Status:** In Progress.
