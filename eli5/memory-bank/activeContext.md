## Current Focus & Next Steps

The immediate next steps involve preparing the app for a review, which has led to temporarily disabling RevenueCat functionality.

1.  **RevenueCat Temporarily Disabled (for Review)**:
    *   **Status:** Done.
    *   **Details:** To simplify the app for a potential review or to focus on non-monetization aspects, RevenueCat integration has been temporarily commented out.
    *   **Affected Files & Sections:**
        *   `lib/main.dart`: RevenueCat initialization block.
        *   `lib/widgets/auth_gate.dart`: `_presentPaywallIfNeeded()` method and its call.
        *   `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`: "Manage Subscription" ListTile.
    *   **Action Required Later:** These sections will need to be uncommented to re-enable monetization features.
2.  **Prepare for App Review (General)**:
    *   Ensure all core functionalities are stable.
    *   Verify UI/UX is clean and intuitive.
    *   **Fill out Google Play Store Listing:** Currently in progress. App name confirmed, short and full descriptions drafted. Graphics and other sections pending.
3.  **Re-enable and Configure RevenueCat (Post-Review/When Ready)**:
    *   Uncomment the sections mentioned above.
    *   Proceed with setting up products in Google Play Console.
    *   Set up corresponding products and entitlements in the RevenueCat dashboard.
    *   Ensure the Service Account JSON for Google Play is correctly configured in RevenueCat for purchase validation.
    *   Thoroughly test the IAP flow.
